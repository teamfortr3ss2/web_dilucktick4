<H1>Who am I?</H1>
<p>I'm a brazilian student trying to learn programming through internet tutorials <br>
    and SENAI classes(SENAI is an institution that offers technical courses here).<br>
</p>
<h3>What things do I like?</h3>
<p>I love playing videogames, eversince I was a child consoles were where I would <br>
   spend my entire day. There are some plenty of games I enjoy but the ones I li-<br>
   ke the most are:Hello Charlotte, the entire Metal Gear franchise and dead by <br>
   daylight(although I haven't played it in a while cuz that game is trash).Also<br>
   I really appreciate listening to all kinds of music, and even though I dont have<br>
   a favourite band hearing <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Dio_Brando" target="_blank">Dio</a> AI covers feels fucking amazing
